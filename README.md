# Description:
Cryptarithmetic puzzles, also known as alphametics, are a type of mathematical game or 
puzzle. In these puzzles, digits are replaced by letters of the alphabet. The primary objective is to crack 
the code: each letter represents a unique digit (from 0 to 9), and the goal is to find a consistent 
substitution that makes the given arithmetic equation true. These puzzles serve not only as entertaining 
brain teasers but also as tools for enhancing logical reasoning, mathematical skills, and problem-solving 
capabilities
